The nearest whole number that is less than or equal to 10.4 is 10, 10.0 is printed. Similarly, since the closest whole number that is less than or equal to -20.4 is -21, -21.0 is printed after. Notice that even if we input a non-decimal number into the floor function, a “double” is returned.Since data precision is not hindered when you convert from an “int” data type to a “double” Java will do it without throwing any errors. The floor function’s primary use is rounding, already there for you to use while coding.
