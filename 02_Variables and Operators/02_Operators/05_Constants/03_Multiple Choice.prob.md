>>Which of the following is a valid identifier for a constant variable? <<

( ) <code>public final int constantVar = 10;</code> {{Incorrect because this is the standard way to declare other variables.}}
( ) <code>public final int CONSTANTVAR = 30;</code> {{Incorrect because it is lacking an underscore.}}
( ) <code>public final boolean constantvar = true;</code> {{Incorrect because the characters are not capitalized and separated with an underscore.}}
(x) <code>double final CONSTANT_VAR = 2.3213;</code> {{Correct because identifiers for constant variables have to be in upper case with words separated with underscore.}}
( ) <code>public final char Constantvar = 'r';</code> {{Incorrect because "var" is not capitalized and separated from "Constant" with an underscore.}}
