>>What will the value of <code>varOne</code> be after the following expression is evaluated?
<code>double varOne = 8+7*4-2.0/4 + (5-3*4-2)</code> <<

(x) 26.5 {{Correct because the order of operation is followed with consideration to integer/float point division.
The process is shown below:
Expression: 8+7<em>4-2.0/4 + (5-3</em>4-2)
          = 8+7<em>4-2.0/4 + (5-12-2)
          = 8+7</em>4-2.0/4 + (-9)
          = 8+28-2.0/4 + (-9)
          = 8+28-0.5 + (-9)
          = 35.5 + (-9)
          = 26.5}}
