>>What will the value of <code>varOne</code> be after the following expression is evaluated?<br/>
<code>double varOne = (5/3) + 2 * 4 % 5</code> <<

( ) 5.0 {{Incorrect because the expression will evaluate to 4.0. View the step-by-step solution for the question by selecting the correct answer, 4.0.}}
( ) 4 {{Incorrect because <code>varOne</code> is a <code>double</code> value.}}
(x) 4.0 {{Correct because it follows the order of operation, which is: 
division/multiplication/modulus, addition/subtraction (left to right).
<p>The process is shown below:</p>
(5/3) + 2 * 4 % 5<br/>
= 1 + 2 * 4 % 5<br/>
= 1 + 8 % 5<br/>
= 1 + 3<br/>
= 4<br/>
= 4.0 (<code>varOne</code> is a <code>double</code>, so whole numbers will be converted to a <code>double</code>  with a decimal point)}}
( ) 4.6667 {{Incorrect because <code>varOne</code> will not only have one decimal point. View the step-by-step solution for the question by selecting the correct answer, 4.0.}}
( ) 6.667 {{Incorrect because the expression will evaluate to 4.0. View the step-by-step solution for the question by selecting the correct answer, 4.0.}}
