The method named “print()” is overloaded when we create two methods with the same name but containing different parameters. One takes in “double” values while the other takes “float” values. The only difference between methods can be the parameters in order for it to be considered "overloading". One rule to keep in mind when working with overloaded methods is that return types for the methods cannot be the only thing that separates one method from the other. For example, creating two methods with the headers “public int methodA()” and “public double methodA()” will result in an error.
