>>Which of the following is the best explanation overriding a method? <<

( ) Defining a method with the same name but with a different number of parameters as another method. {{incorrect because it is an example of overloading methods. (This will be discussed later in the course)}}
( ) Defining a method with the same name but with parameters with different data types as another method. {{incorrect because it is an example of overloading methods. (This will be discussed later in the course)}}
(x) Defining a method with the same name and parameters as an inherited method. {{correct because you need to create a method with the same name and parameter as an inherited method for it to be an overridden method.}}
( ) Defining a method with the same name but with a different number of parameters as an inherited method. {{incorrect because it is an example of overloading methods. (This will be discussed later in the course)}}
( ) Defining a method with the same precondition as another method. {{incorrect because preconditions are simply a tool for communication and don't affect the what the method does at all.}}

||Overriding a method is related to the inheritance. ||
