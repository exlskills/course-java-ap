>>Which of the following statements about abstract classes and interfaces is true? <<

( ) An abstract class cannot extend another abstract class. {{Incorrect because abstract classes are allowed to extend other classes.}}
( ) An abstract class cannot implement an interface. Incorrect because an abstract class can implement an interface as long as all the methods in the interface are implemented.}}
( ) All subclasses of a class that implements an interface do not automatically implement the interface. {{Incorrect because all subclasses of a class that implements an interface automatically implement that interface.}}
( ) You can't declare variables with the type of an abstract class. {{Incorrect because you can declare variables of an abstract class type but you cannot create objects from an abstract class.}}
(x)  If an abstract class has no implemented constructors or methods, it is better to make it an interface. {{Correct because abstract classes can have actual constructors and implemented methods while an interface does not.}}

||Abstract class can implement an interface or extend another abstract class.||
