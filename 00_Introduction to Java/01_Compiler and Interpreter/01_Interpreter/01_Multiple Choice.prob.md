( ) Java compiler {{Incorrect because the Java compiler is used to translate the source code into Java bytecode.}}
( ) Java debugger {{Incorrect because the Java debugger is used to find and fix bugs in Java programs.}}
(x) Java virtual machine (JVM) {{Correct because the Java virtual machine interprets compiled Java bytecode for a computer's processor so that it can perform a Java program's instructions.}}
( ) Java API {{Incorrect because the Java API is a set of classes that are written using the Java language and run on the Java virtual machine.}}
