This program is comprised of two primary features:

1. Class Definition - the keyword `class` begins the class definition for a `class` named name. The code for each class goes between the opening and closing braces. The class name format is UpperCamelCase, meaning the first letter of every word is capitalized and there are no spaces between the words. 
2. Main Method - Every application must contain a class that has been declared the main method with signature `public static void main(String[] args)`. We will dive further into declaring methods, and terms such as `public`, `static` and `void` as we move further along. For now, remember how to declare a main method.

Special Note: A vital aspect of syntax to keep in mind as we move forward is that every statement must end in a semi-colon (;), as you see above in our Hello World example.
