The “compareTo” method compares the first letter of one “String” object to the first letter of another ”String” object and returns a number that states which “String” comes first in lexicographic order (A,B,C etc.) If the first two letters of the strings are the same, the method will go on to compare the next letters, and the next until it finds the first instance of a difference. Let’s take a look at how this method works.
