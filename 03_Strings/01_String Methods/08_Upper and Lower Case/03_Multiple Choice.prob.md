>>Consider the following code segment:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">String varOne = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(varOne.toLowerCase());
</code></pre>
<p>What is printed as a result of executing this code segment? <<

( ) Hello world! {{Incorrect because only some of the letters are converted to lower case.}}
(x) hello world! {{Correct because all the letters are converted to lower case.}}
( ) HELLO WORLD! {{Incorrect because all the letters are converted to upper case.}}
( ) hello world {{Incorrect because it is missing the exclamation mark at the end.}}
( ) An error will be thrown {{Incorrect because <code>toLowerCase()</code> is a valid <code>String</code> method.}}

||Look carefully at the answer choices to see which <code>String</code> values still have upper case letters. ||
