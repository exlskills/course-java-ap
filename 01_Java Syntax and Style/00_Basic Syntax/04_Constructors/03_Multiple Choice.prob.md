>>What best describes the purpose of a constructor? <<

(x) Initializes the fields in the object. {{correct because a constructor initializes the fields to their default values.}}
( ) Determines the amount of space needed for an object and creates the object. {{incorrect because the object is already created before the constructor is called.}}
( ) Names the new methods. {{incorrect because constructors don't name the methods.}}
( ) Cleans all the memory used by this instance of the class. {{incorrect because the "freeing" of memory is automatically executed by Java when the object is no longer referenced.}}
( ) Informs the user that a new instance has been created. {{incorrect because constructors do not necessarily inform the user of anything.}}

||The constructor does not return anything. ||
