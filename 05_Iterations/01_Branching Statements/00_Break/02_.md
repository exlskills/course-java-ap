The “if” statement has the expression “count == 5”, so when “count” has a value of 5 the statements inside the “if” statement will be executed, including the “break;” statement, which will terminate the “for” loop so any number after 5 will not be printed. “Break;” does not affect the “if” statement, it terminates the whole loop. When the “break;” statement is used appropriately it saves time when running the program because you wouldn’t have to loop through the same statements over and over again.
