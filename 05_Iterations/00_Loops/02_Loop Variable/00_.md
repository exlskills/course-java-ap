Now that we are working with loops, let’s explore “loop control variables.” Loop control variables are ordinary “int” variables that are used to dictate elements such as how many times a loop will execute. Not all loops will necessarily have loop control variables, but it is important to recognize if it is present. Look at the program below which shows similar code to the previous two topics.
